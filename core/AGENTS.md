# AGENTS.md

## Scope

This crate is `api_clients_core`, the shared Rust library crate used by the
service-specific API clients in this workspace.

Use the repository root `AGENTS.md` first, then this file. Use the
`rust-library-review` skill for public API, docs, package, or agent-guidance
changes.

## Crate Purpose

`api_clients_core` owns common transport and error behavior:

- `Executor` for HTTP GET, POST with query strings, and POST with JSON body.
- `Executor::builder(api_endpoint)` for retry count, timeout, and injected HTTP
  middleware client configuration.
- `ApiClientsError` and `ApiClientsResult` for common error handling.

It should stay service-agnostic. Service endpoint paths, request parameters, and
response models belong in the service crates.

## Public API Boundary

Treat these as public library contracts:

- `Executor`
- `Executor::builder`
- `Executor::exec_get`
- `Executor::exec_get_extra`
- `Executor::exec_post_qs`
- `Executor::exec_post_body`
- `ApiClientsError`
- `ApiClientsResult`

`ApiClientsError` is `#[non_exhaustive]`; downstream matches need wildcard arms
so new error variants can be added without breaking minor releases.

Do not change URL construction, retry defaults, timeout defaults, error
classification, or response parsing semantics without reviewing every service
crate and downstream integration guidance.

## Important Gotchas

- `Executor` joins endpoint and path as `"{endpoint}/{path}"`. Endpoint strings
  normally must not end with `/`.
- `exec_get` sends an empty serde query object, which currently produces a URL
  with a trailing `?`.
- All successful responses are parsed as JSON. Non-JSON success bodies become
  `ApiClientsError::UnexpectedResponse`.
- 4xx responses map to `Client`; 5xx responses map to `Server`; other reqwest
  errors map through the reqwest conversions.

## Downstream Integration Guidance

Final applications usually depend on a service crate instead of this crate
directly. Use `api_clients_core` directly only when:

- injecting a shared `Executor` into multiple generated clients
- configuring retry count, timeout, or reqwest middleware once
- building a new service wrapper in this workspace

Application code should handle `ApiClientsError` explicitly and avoid
panic-driven response handling.

## Validation

For this crate:

```bash
cargo test -p api_clients_core
cargo +nightly fmt
cargo clippy -p api_clients_core --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
RUSTDOCFLAGS="-D warnings" cargo doc -p api_clients_core --no-deps
```

If transport behavior changes, also run every service crate test that can cover
request construction and response parsing.
